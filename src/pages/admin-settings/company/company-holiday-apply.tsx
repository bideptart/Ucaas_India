/* Putting the company holiday list onto many lines at once.
 *
 * The company calendar next door (`company-holidays.tsx`) is a record only.
 * Routing still reads each line's own holiday list, so today an admin who has
 * declared Christmas once has to open every queue, every IVR menu, every person
 * and every number and press "Import company holidays" inside each one's
 * business-hours dialog. Forty-four lines is forty-four trips. established systems applies
 * one holiday to many lines from a single screen; this is that.
 *
 * Nothing here is new logic. `buildHolidayImport` already decides what a line
 * should receive, and the same rules apply whether it is called once from a
 * dialog or two hundred times from here:
 *
 *   - A holiday on a line MUST carry both `type.value` and `value.value`
 *     (`holidaySchema`, src/pages/admin-settings/constants.ts). A row with
 *     an empty action does not fall back to anything — it fails validation and
 *     blocks that line's whole form from saving, on a screen that never explains
 *     why. So a line whose action cannot be resolved is REPORTED AS SKIPPED and
 *     is not written at all.
 *   - Holidays already on the line are never touched. `buildHolidayImport`
 *     dedupes on name and start date, and the new rows are appended to the
 *     stored array rather than replacing it.
 *   - A line holds at most ten holidays, so what did not fit is named.
 *
 * Every save writes the line's WHOLE record back, read fresh from the server
 * with exactly one slot changed. All four endpoints here replace rather than
 * patch — `/api/user/update` most notoriously, which is why
 * `assignVoicemailGreeting` (src/lib/voicemail-greeting.ts) echoes the person
 * back field for field. A payload assembled from assumptions about what a record
 * contains is how settings get silently dropped, and this codebase has already
 * paid for that once.
