--[[
  Send a finished call recording to storage, then tell the API which call it
  belongs to.

  Run from the dialplan as a hangup hook, so there is NO session by the time
  this executes - everything it needs arrives as arguments.

      api_hangup_hook=lua upload_recording.lua <call_uuid> <company_uuid>

  Why not the upload code already in functions.lua: that aims at fs_upload_url,
  a name defined nowhere, using a multipart shape from an API that no longer
  exists. This uses the presigned flow the platform actually serves today - ask
  for a URL, PUT the file, then link it to the call.

  Nothing here is fatal. A hangup hook that throws leaves FreeSWITCH logging a
  Lua error on every call, and a lost recording must not become a lost call.
