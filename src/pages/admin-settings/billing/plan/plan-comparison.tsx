/* What each plan actually includes, side by side.
 *
 * Choosing a plan here showed three things: the name, the price and how many
 * seats. Not how many minutes, not how many texts, nothing about AI. So the one
 * question somebody is actually asking — "what do I get for the extra twelve
 * dollars" — could not be answered on the screen where they answer it.
 *
 * The figures come from the same catalogue the rest of billing reads, so a
 * price shown here cannot disagree with a price charged elsewhere.
 *
 * Every row here is something the platform genuinely counts: minutes, texts and
 * numbers. A service the platform holds an allowance for but measures nothing
 * against carries "Not counted yet" on its own row rather than being shown
 * identically to the measured ones — a customer who plans around an allowance
 * nobody counts finds out at the worst possible moment.
 *
 * Unlimited is a word in this table, never a number. Two of these plans include
 * unlimited domestic calling, and the plan record has to hold that as a very
 * large figure because the column takes whole numbers. Printing it would put
 * "999,999,999 minutes" on a pricing table.
