/* The extras you can have on top of your plan, and which you already have.
 *
 * An add-on here is a licence bought per seat, not a switch on this page. So
 * this screen tells you what each one does, what it saves you doing, and
 * whether your plan already includes it — and it is honest that buying one is
 * not something this screen can do yet.
 *
 * Prices appear only where the product owner has actually set one, and those
 * come from the plan catalogue that the plan comparison reads, so the two
 * cannot disagree. Everything else says "Not available yet" rather than
 * carrying a number invented here — a number somebody would budget against.
 *
 * There is no purchase button, because the only endpoint that buys licences
 * charges the amount the browser sends it rather than the amount it works out
 * itself — a button here would be a button that trusts the browser with a
 * price.
 *
 * What IS real is the badge on each card. Whether your plan includes an add-on
 * is read from the plan the platform reports for your company, so it is the
 * truth about this account rather than a guess.
