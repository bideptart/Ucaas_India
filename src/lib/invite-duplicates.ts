/* Somebody you are inviting is already here — or is in the list twice.
 *
 * THE PROBLEM
 *
 * The invite form adds up to ten people at once and checks each field against
 * the platform one at a time, as it is typed. That catches an email address
 * that already belongs to somebody. It does not catch the two mistakes that
 * actually happen when an administrator is pasting a list:
 *
 *   The same person typed twice in the same batch. Neither row has been saved
 *   yet, so neither is "already taken" as far as the platform is concerned.
 *   Both rows pass, the request goes, and the whole batch fails on a database
 *   error with nothing on screen saying which two rows were the problem.
 *
 *   The same person who is already on the account, described as a taken field
 *   rather than as a person. "Email already exists" does not tell an
 *   administrator that Amara Osei is sitting in the London office right now, or
 *   what to do about it.
 *
 * ONE PERSON, ONE PLACE
 *
 * A person belongs to exactly one location. That is not a limitation of this
 * screen, it is what a person *is* here: their extension, their number, their
 * opening hours and their timezone all come from the location they sit in, and
 * a person in two locations would have two of each. So there is no such thing
 * as adding somebody a second time to move them. The answer is always to open
 * the person who already exists and change their location, and every message in
 * this file says that in those words rather than leaving somebody to work it
 * out.
 *
 * WHAT COUNTS AS THE SAME PERSON
 *
 * The email address, and nothing else. It is what somebody signs in with, so
 * two people cannot share one. Names are not evidence: two people really are
 * called Sarah Jones. Phone numbers and extensions are checked too, but as
 * clashes over a *thing* rather than as evidence of the same person — an
 * extension somebody has just left is very often typed for the person
 * replacing them.
 *
 * WHY THE PLATFORM'S OWN CHECK IS NOT ENOUGH
 *
 * The form already asks the platform whether an email address is free, and the
 * platform answers "Email already exists!" — four words with no name, no
 * location, and one further problem: that check looks at every company on the
 * platform, not just yours. An address belonging to a completely different
 * organisation comes back the same way as your own colleague's. An
 * administrator reading it concludes their colleague is already set up, goes
 * looking, and finds nobody.
 *
 * So the roster you are already looking at is checked as well, and the two
 * answers together say something useful: found here, and we can name the person
 * and where they sit; not found here but the platform says taken, and the
 * honest answer is that the address belongs to somebody outside this company.
 *
 * It reads and writes nothing: give it the rows on the form and the roster
 * already on screen, get back a list of problems in plain sentences.
