/* Default permissions — what a person should be able to do on their first day.
 *
 * Adding somebody today asks for a role and nothing else, and whatever that role
 * happens to hold is what they get. Nothing in the product ever decided what a
 * role *should* hold, so the roles that ship grant almost the same thing to
 * everybody: an agent's role and an administrator's role differ by two tick
 * boxes out of a hundred and forty, both about call logs. Every other tick box,
 * billing included, is on for both.
 *
 * This screen is where that gets decided. For each kind of person it works out
 * the permissions they should start with, says why each group of capabilities
 * sits where it does, shows how far the company's current role is from that, and
 * offers to write it down as a role that can then be picked when adding people.
 *
 * The rules and the reasoning live in `lib/role-permission-defaults.ts` with
 * their own tests. This file is only the part somebody touches.
 *
 * Two things it is careful to be honest about, because an administrator who
 * believes otherwise would find out the wrong way:
 *
 *   Permissions decide what the app puts on screen. The platform does not check
 *   them when it answers a request, so a tighter role is a tidier product, not a
 *   locked one. The card says so.
 *
 *   A permission applies to the whole company. There is no column saying which
 *   office or team somebody looks after, so "manager" here means the routing of
 *   every team rather than of theirs. See Admin scope next door, which records
 *   the missing half.
