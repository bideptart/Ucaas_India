/* Month view's visible viewport is fixed at 5 week-rows regardless of the
   month — a 4-week month (Feb 2026) leaves the 5th row's worth of space
   blank, a 6-week month (Aug 2026) has its 6th row reachable by scrolling,
   and every row is the same height in every case. The library itself has
   no such option: left alone it either forces every month to a fixed
   `visibleWeeksCount` (padding short months with extra weeks of the next
   month, which was the prior behaviour) or auto-sizes the number of DOM
   rows to the real month (0/unset) while stretching or squeezing row
   height to fill whatever container it's given. Getting a FIXED row
   height with a VARIABLE row count needs two nested boxes: an outer one
   sized for exactly 5 rows (`calShellOuterRef`, scrollable), and an inner
   one the library actually renders into (`tuiRef`) whose height this file
   sets imperatively to `weeksNeeded * rowHeight`, so dividing that back

       full 24-hour column, unclipped — and the library's own dayname
       header + scrollable timegrid (`.tui-full-calendar-timegrid-
       container`, sticky-by-construction: it's a sibling of the
       header, not an ancestor) never gets a bounded height to scroll
       *within*. Lacking that, there's nothing here for the library to
       scroll internally, so the outer box (`calShellOuterRef`, already
       height-capped for Month's fixed 5 rows) ends up the thing that
       actually scrolls instead — carrying the header along with it,
       which is what read as the weekday row scrolling out of view.
       Giving this box the outer box's own real height, the same way
       `applyMonthRowHeight` already does for Month, gives the library a
       real number to divide "header + scrollable body" against, so the
       header row stays out of that scroll — through the library's own
       layout, not a new sticky rule layered on top of it. */

       correctly by controlling *ancestors* of the library's own scroll
       box — matching `inner`'s height to `outer`'s, then clipping
       `inner` to soak up the difference. Both failed, confirmed live,
       for the same underlying reason: the library's own timegrid
       doesn't reliably respect a height it's handed through its
       ancestors. On a tall window the mismatch was a harmless 6px; on a
       short one it was 206px — the library kept a much taller internal
       minimum than the space `inner` actually had, so `outer` was
       forced to pick up that entire 206px as scroll capacity of its
       own, and `position: sticky` (confirmed live, repeatedly) does not
       hold `.tui-full-calendar-dayname-container` against *that specific
       box's* scroll — the header scrolled fully off-screen, reproducing
       the exact bug this was meant to fix. Clipping the mismatch away
       instead (the previous attempt) avoided that but silently deleted
       however many hours fell past the clip line — worse.

       This instead sizes and scrolls the library's own real scroll
       element directly, `.tui-full-calendar-timegrid-container`, rather
       than negotiating with it indirectly through two ancestors. Its
       available height is `outer`'s height minus the dayname row's own
       measured height (the same subtraction `applyMonthRowHeight`
       already does for Month); setting that height AND `overflow-y:
       auto` on it directly, inline, wins over whatever internal
       minimum-height logic the library was otherwise falling back to,
       so it scrolls within itself instead of overflowing its
       ancestors — which means neither `outer` nor `inner` ever has
       anything of their own to scroll, and the header, a sibling of
       this box rather than a scroll-context descendant of it, simply
       never moves. */

       navigation of their own, since that date could only ever be
       whatever the mini calendar last set, which stays within the
       month's first week. Now that the Day/Week arrows can move it to
       any day, that matters: with `visibleWeeksCount` constrained (see
       `applyMonthRowHeight`), the library anchors the grid to the WEEK
       containing that current date rather than to the 1st of the month —
       so leaving it on, say, the 9th made the grid start from the week of
       the 9th, silently dropping the month's first row.

       Tried fixing this through `month.renderMonth` via `setOptions`
       instead of `setDate`, on the theory that it's the grid's own
       separate date reference and wouldn't disturb what day Day/Week
       shows if switched back to — but `changeView` always calls the
       library's own `move(0)` internally, which recomputes that same
       option from `_renderDate` and overwrites it regardless. Confirmed
       live: the `renderMonth` option does not survive `changeView`, so
       `setDate` is the only lever that actually reaches the anchor. The
       trade-off is real but minor next to a grid missing a row: Day/Week
       lands on the 1st of the month, not whatever day they were on
       before switching to Month — the same "moving up a level resets to

       mouse never having physically moved, leaves that cell exactly as
       shaded as it was — a browser only re-runs `:hover` matching on an
       actual pointer move, never because the DOM changed under a
       stationary cursor. That shaded rectangle, with nothing left to
       click, is what read as a "ghost bar" still sitting on the grid.
       `:hover` itself is opaque to JS — confirmed live: toggling
       `pointer-events` on the element does not change whether it still
       matches `:hover`. So the class is applied by real `mouseover`/
       `mouseout` listeners below instead — visually identical for

        {/* `mcm-calshell` is now the fixed-for-5-rows VIEWPORT — its own
            height is the same responsive `calc(100vh-Npx)` sizing as
            before, unchanged. `tuiRef` inside it is the plain box the
            library actually renders into; its height is set imperatively
            per month (see `applyMonthRowHeight`) so a 4-week month leaves
            blank space at the bottom of this same box, and a 6-week month
            overflows it, reachable by this box's own scroll — the library
            never sees a container whose height depends on the month, so
            its own row-height math never stretches or squeezes rows.

            The `lg` reservation was 190px, measured a bit optimistically —
            in practice the header row above this card (date heading, view
            switch, sync buttons) plus its own margins run closer to 200px,
            and the page's `lg:overflow-hidden` wrapper has no scrollbar to
            fall back on, so those extra few pixels were hard-clipping row
            5's own bottom edge rather than just leaving less breathing
            room. 205px leaves a small buffer instead of a razor's edge. */}
        {/* Tried `lg:overflow-hidden` here for Day/Week, on the theory
            that the library's own internal timegrid scroll
            (`.tui-full-calendar-timegrid-container`, genuinely
            scrollable — confirmed live: `scrollHeight` 1248px against a
            593px `clientHeight`, all 24 hours present) should be the
            only scroll path, with this outer box just a fixed frame
            around it. It measurably backfired: with this box
            `overflow-hidden`, a real mouse-wheel scroll over the grid
            did nothing at all — `scrollTop` stayed 0 on both this box
            and the inner timegrid — while directly setting
            `timegrid.scrollTop` via script still worked. Browsers appear
            to stop dispatching wheel input at an `overflow-hidden`
            ancestor rather than passing it through to a scrollable
            descendant, so hours past whatever fit in view (7 PM on a
            typical window) became unreachable by any real scroll
            gesture, only by script. `overflow-auto` here for every view
            — the original, unconditional behaviour — keeps this box
            itself a valid wheel-scroll target, which lets the browser's
            normal scroll-chaining hand the gesture down to the inner
            timegrid correctly. The header staying put no longer depends
            on this box specifically not scrolling — `position: sticky`
            on `.tui-full-calendar-dayname-container` (styles.css) pins
            it to the top of whichever ancestor actually does the
            scrolling, so it's correct either way. */}

              small mismatch between this box's set height and the
              library's actual rendered content (639px content in a 633px
              box, on a tall window — confirmed live). It backfired worse
              than the problem it solved: on a shorter window, that same
              mismatch was 206px, not a handful — the library keeps some
              internal minimum height for the hour column regardless of
              how little space `applyDayWeekHeight` actually had to give
              it, and clipping here doesn't just trim a few stray px in
              that case, it permanently hides however many real hours
              (and their events) fall past the clip line, with no scroll
              able to reach them ever again. A header that's occasionally
              a few px off is a cosmetic bug; hours silently missing is a
              functional one, and a much worse trade. Left as plain
              `w-full` for every view — the library's own internal
              timegrid scroll (`.tui-full-calendar-timegrid-container`,
              a descendant, its own separate `overflow: scroll` context)
