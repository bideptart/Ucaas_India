/* What each kind of person can do — the whole access model on one page.
 *
 * Before this existed, the only way to find out what a role meant was to open it
 * and read a hundred and forty tick boxes, which tells you what a role holds but
 * never why. An administrator deciding who should be what needs the opposite:
 * the shape first, the tick boxes later.
 *
 * So this page is a table. Down the side, every capability in the product,
 * grouped by the part of the product it belongs to. Across the top, the six
 * kinds of person. Every cell is a yes or a no. Above it are the five principles
 * that decide which cell gets which, because the principles are the part worth
 * remembering — somebody who has read those five lines can work out the answer
 * for a capability that is not on the table yet.
 *
 * The table is generated from the same rules the default permissions are
 * generated from. A table typed out by hand beside the rules would start correct
 * and drift within a month, and then this page would be confidently explaining a
 * model nobody was using.
 *
 * It describes the model, so it saves nothing and has no buttons. What it says
 * about enforcement is on the card, and it is the same thing every screen in
 * this area says: these permissions decide what the app puts on screen, and the
 * platform does not check them when it answers a request.

              Works in this app. Permissions decide what this app puts on screen, and nothing behind
              it checks them again — so a tighter role makes the product simpler for the person
              using it rather than locking anything away. Reach is the part that is coming soon:
              which departments somebody looks after is not stored yet, so a Department
              Admin&rsquo;s permissions currently apply to every department, not only theirs. Admin
              scope, step 3, is where reach is written down ready for that.
