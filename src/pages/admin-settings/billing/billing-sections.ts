/* The one list of billing screens.
 *
 * Until now the sidebar kept its own list of billing links and the router kept
 * its own list of billing routes, by hand, in two files that nobody edits at
 * the same time. That is how a menu ends up pointing at a page that no longer
 * exists, and how a page ends up shipping with no way to reach it. Both now
 * read this, so a screen cannot appear in one and be missing from the other.
 *
 * `path` is relative to /admin-settings/billing. `ABSOLUTE` builds the full
 * address so nothing has to concatenate it by hand.
 *
 * **Everything in here is admin-only, deliberately.** Billing used to sit
 * behind the same phone-system feature flag as call handling, which is the
 * wrong question entirely — whether a company has bought the calling module has
 * nothing to do with whether this person is allowed to see the company's
 * invoices. Who may look at money is an administrator question, so that is the
 * check that guards these pages.
