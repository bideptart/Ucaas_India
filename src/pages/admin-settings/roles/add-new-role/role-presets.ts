/* Ready-made roles, so a company does not have to invent them.
 *
 * ONE SET OF NAMES, EVERYWHERE A PERSON LOOKS
 *
 * These are the same five names the built-in roles are shown under - see
 * src/lib/role-display-names.ts. There were briefly three vocabularies on this
 * screen: the stored ADMIN/MANAGER/SUB-ADMIN/AGENT, a set of presets, and a set
 * of display labels. Three names for one idea is worse than an ugly name.
 *
 * The stored strings stay as they are because the platform compares them
 * directly as an authorisation gate - `role !== "ADMIN"` in AuthMiddleware and
 * 32 other places - so they are internal identifiers, like a primary key, and
 * nobody sees them.
 *
 * Until now a new role started from nothing or from a copy of ADMIN, SUB-ADMIN,
 * MANAGER or AGENT. Neither helps somebody who wants the ordinary thing every
 * company wants: a person who runs reports, or handles people, and touches
 * nothing else.
 *
 * The names are ours. An earlier version borrowed another product's five word
 * for word, reasoning that somebody moving across would recognise them. That is
 * a bad trade: it puts a competitor's vocabulary inside our product, where it
 * stays for as long as the product does, in exchange for a moment of
 * familiarity during one signup. These say what the person does instead, which
 * is what the rest of this console already does - "What each role can do",
 * rather than a job title.
 *
 * WHY THESE ARE FEATURE LISTS AND NOT PERMISSION TREES
 * `constants.ts` carries a warning worth repeating: a hard-coded permission tree
 * in this folder once caused removed and renamed backend keys to be submitted.
 * So a preset never spells out a permission. It names top-level features, and
 * `buildPresetPermission` walks the company's OWN live plan tree and switches on
 * what it finds there. A key that no longer exists cannot be sent, because the
 * only keys used are the ones the company just told us about.
