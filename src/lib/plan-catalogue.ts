/* The plans we sell, what each includes, and what anything extra costs.
 *
 * One place, so a price cannot be right on the pricing page and wrong on the
 * bill. Every figure here maps onto a column the platform's plan record already
 * has, so this can seed those records rather than living beside them and
 * drifting.
 *
 * THE SHAPE, and why it is this shape
 *
 * A plan carries an allowance per service. Those are used first and cost
 * nothing. Past the allowance the service does not stop - each further minute,
 * text or reply is charged one at a time from the customer's balance. The rules
 * for that live in `plan-allowance.ts` and are tested there; this file is only
 * the numbers.
 *
 * UNLIMITED IS NOT A BIG NUMBER
 *
 * The trap this file exists to avoid. Two plans here include unlimited domestic
 * calling, and the obvious ways to store that are all wrong in the same
 * direction:
 *
 *   0 means every minute is charged from the first one
 *   null or undefined becomes NaN in arithmetic, and NaN comparisons are false,
 *     so "used > included" is false and it silently looks free - until some
 *     other sum turns NaN into a charge
 *   999999 works until somebody genuinely passes it
 *
 * So unlimited is its own value, `UNLIMITED`, and every function that reads an
 * allowance has to decide what to do with it rather than doing arithmetic on it
 * by accident. Getting this wrong bills an unlimited customer for calls they
 * were promised free, which is the worst billing bug there is: it looks correct
 * to us and outrageous to them.
