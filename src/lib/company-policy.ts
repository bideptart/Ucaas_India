/* Turning the company's override flags into an actual lock.
 *
 * Each setting in the company record carries an `override` flag meaning "a person
 * may change this one on their own phone". Until now nothing read it: the personal
 * settings page stripped `override` out before saving and decided editability from
 * job title alone — an admin could change everything, everyone else could change
 * nothing. That is the wrong shape. "Anyone may pick their ringtone, nobody may
 * turn off call recording" was impossible to express.
 *
 * This reads the flags and answers one question per field: may this person change
 * it. Two rules keep it safe to switch on:
 *
 *   - It applies only on someone's own settings page. Every other screen using the
 *     shared editor is an admin configuring a number, department, IVR or queue, and
 *     locking those would be nonsense.
 *   - With no company record saved, it defers entirely to the old behaviour. A
 *     tenant that has never opened the company page sees no change at all, rather
 *     than every field silently locking because absent flags read as false.

       This used to read the single `override` flag directly, which carried two
       contradictory jobs: on this page it meant "the person may change it", and
       when provisioning a new person it meant "copy this value onto them". One
       bit could not say both, so "everyone gets this and nobody may change it"

       now; a record holding only the old flag still reads exactly as it did. */
