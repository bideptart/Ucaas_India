 * is rendered once by the Admin shell instead, in a bar the same height as the
 * sidebar's own title bar, so the two titles sit on one line on every screen.
 *
 * The title comes from `adminSettingArr` — the same registry the nav and the
 * landing page read — so a screen cannot end up with a heading that disagrees
 * with the link that got you there. A page supplies anything the registry
 * cannot know (its description, its own actions, a title the registry has no
