/**
 * Company ring time
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * How long a phone rings before the call gives up is one of the two numbers a
 * customer changes first, and until now there was nowhere to say it once for the
 * whole company. It could only be set in three unrelated places:
 *
 *   - per queue member, in Call Queue > Ring strategy ("Ring For")
 *   - per department, as "Member Ring Timeout (Sec)"
 *   - per device on one person's phone, in their Call rules > device options
 *
 * A new person gets whatever the code happens to default to. This page is the
 * missing top level: one number, written down once, in the same reserved
 * "Company Default" record the rest of Company info uses. It is namespaced under
 * `settings.company_ring_time` and the rest of that blob is spread through
 * untouched on save.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT READS THIS, AS OF 29 AUGUST 2026
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * This header used to say "nothing reads this value", and warned against
 * leaving a stale reassurance behind. That warning now applies to the header
 * itself: the key IS read, and `RING_TIME_STATUS` is 'active'.
 *
 * The reader is `seedDeviceRingTime` in src/lib/company-ring-time.ts, which
 * returns a stored per-device value if one exists and otherwise falls back to
 * this company number instead of a hardcoded constant. Three call sites use it:
 *
 *   - people/update-forwarding/index.tsx      (Call rules > device options)
 *   - phone-systems/call-queue/add-edit-call-queue/index.tsx
 *   - phone-systems/call-queue/.../ring-strategy/index.tsx
 *
 * So a device or queue member saved through the interface without its own ring
 * time now inherits what is set here. What this page still does NOT do is
 * change anything already saved with an explicit value — those were somebody's
 * decision and are kept, unclamped, by design (see seedDeviceRingTime).
 *
 * If that ever stops being true, change this note in the same commit. An admin
 * who believes they have shortened the ring and has not will read every missed
 * call as a fault somewhere else.
