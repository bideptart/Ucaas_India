/**
 * Company calling permissions
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The established systems Office Settings that decide which number a person may show on an
 * outbound call, and where they may send a call once it is connected. They are
 * kept in the reserved user_template row called "Company Default", namespaced
 * under `settings.company_calling_permissions`, so nothing else in that blob is
 * touched on save.
 *
 * These are toll-fraud controls, not conveniences. Every one of them defaults to
 * OFF, which is how the safe default ships them, because each one is a way of turning a
 * call the company already pays for into a second leg the company also pays for —
 * and an outside caller who can reach a transfer prompt can dial a premium-rate
 * number on your bill.
 *
 * IMPORTANT — nothing in this product reads `settings.company_calling_permissions.*`
 * yet. Checked, then verified per setting:
 *
 *   - Caller ID choices are built in `src/hooks/use-dialpad-caller-id-options.ts`.
 *     It lists only the DIDs assigned to the signed-in user (`useGetAssignedDIDNumbers`,
 *     src/hooks/common.ts:72) and offers no office/group number and no hidden option,
 *     so neither caller-ID setting below has anything to switch on or off today.
 *   - Transfer targets are typed in `src/components/dialpad/components/dialpad-transfer-list.tsx`
 *     and dispatched by `handleTransfer` in `src/context/dialpad-context.tsx:2460`.
 *     The only check on an external target is `length >= 3` — no company lookup,
 *     no country test, no direction test.
 *   - Admin-side external forwarding destinations come from
 *     `src/components/custom/forwarding-actions.tsx` (the `PHONE` case, line 251),
 *     an unrestricted phone input that accepts any country.
 *
 * So every control on this page is a recorded decision, not an enforced rule. Each
 * one says so in its own words. Do not soften those notes: telling an admin a fraud
 * control is protecting them when it is not is worse than not shipping the control.
 *
 * The same is true of the newest control here, "Calling other countries", and it
 * is the most expensive one to get wrong in either direction. Its decision lives
 * in src/lib/international-calling.ts with its own tests; this screen only asks
 * the question and stores the answer, under
 * `settings.company_calling_permissions.international_calling`. Read that file
 * before changing anything about it — in particular, why the answer is NOT
 * stored on the `companies.allow_country` column (that column is the plan's
 * entitlement, filled at signup, and the console cannot write it), and why an
 * account that has configured nothing must go on calling everywhere.

                The transfer switches below start off, which is the safe default. Calling other
                countries does not: until you choose a list, every country is allowed. That is the
                one worth setting today. Each control here is a way of turning a call you already
                pay for into a second leg you also pay for. Toll fraud works by getting someone — or
                something — to transfer a call out to a premium-rate number abroad and leaving it
                up; the bill arrives days later. Turn a box on only when a real job needs it, and
                turn it off again when that job ends.
