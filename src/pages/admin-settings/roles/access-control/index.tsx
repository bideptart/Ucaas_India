/* Access control — the front door to the four screens that decide who can do what.
 *
 * The pieces were built one at a time, and ended up as four sidebar entries with
 * nothing joining them: Roles, Admin scope, Default permissions, and the
 * capability table. An administrator landing on any one of them had no way of
 * knowing there were three more, which came first, or that the four together are
 * one decision rather than four settings.
 *
 * This screen is that decision written down in order:
 *
 *   1. Decide which kind of person somebody is.
 *   2. Set what that kind of person can do.
 *   3. Set how far it reaches.
 *   4. Choose what a brand-new person starts on.
 *
 * Each step says what it decides, what happens if it is skipped, and opens the
 * screen that does it. Nothing is saved here — it is a map, and a map that saved
 * things would be a fifth place to look.
 *
 * The tiers are shown too, because step 1 is a decision an administrator has to
 * make in their head before any screen can help them, and it is the one they are
 * most likely to get wrong: the names look like a seniority ladder and are
 * actually a statement about reach.
