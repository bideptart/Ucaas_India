/* Admin scope — which part of the company each administrator covers.
 *
 * The Roles screen next door answers "what may this person do". It has no answer
 * for "to whom", so a role that grants "edit user" grants it over everybody. This
 * screen is where the second half is written down: this person covers the whole
 * company, this one covers London and Manchester, this one covers the support
 * queue and nothing else.
 *
 * The rules — what a valid scope is, who each scope reaches, who may change one —
 * live in `lib/admin-scope.ts` with their own tests. This file is only the part
 * somebody touches.
 *
 * It is deliberately honest about what it is. The platform's API does not check
 * scope on any request today, so what is saved here is a written record of who
 * should administer what, not a lock. The card says exactly that, and it will
 * keep saying it until the API enforces it. An administrator told their locations
 * are separated, when nothing separates them, would find out the wrong way.
 *
 * Stored under `settings.admin_scopes` on the company record, the same place the
 * other company-wide lists live.
