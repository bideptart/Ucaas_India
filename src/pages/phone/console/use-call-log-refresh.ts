/**
 * Refreshes the call lists when a call ends.
 *
 * The lists are infinite queries and nothing was telling them a call had
 * happened. They refetched on mount, on window refocus, or when someone
 * pressed the refresh button — so a call placed from this very page did not
 * appear afterwards, and looked like the log was simply slow.
 *
 * There are two of them and they are keyed differently: the console's own
 * column is `console-call-list`, while Calls, Recordings and Voicemails all
 * render `pages/phone/call-list` and key on `callListing`. Only the first was
 * being invalidated, so a call placed from the console showed up there but the
 * Calls tab still had to be left and re-entered before it appeared.
 *
 * The delays are the point. The CDR is written server-side *after* the switch
 * tears the call down, so invalidating the instant the session ends usually
 * refetches a moment too early and shows the same stale list. Rather than pick
 * one delay and hope, it retries on a short schedule and stops as soon as the
 * call shows up.
