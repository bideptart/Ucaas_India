/* Usage — what the plan includes, what has been used, and where the money went.
 *
 * This page replaces the old Spending screen and absorbs everything it did.
 * They were always two halves of one question. Spending could tell you that
 * $400 went on calls to Germany; it could not tell you whether the first 400
 * minutes were included and only the rest was charged. The plan screen knew the
 * allowances but nothing about where the calls went. Somebody trying to work
 * out why a bill went up had to hold both pages in their head.
 *
 * The honest limits, stated here because they shape the whole screen:
 *
 * **The allowance table is cycle-to-date and ignores the date picker.** Those
 * used-counts are running totals held against the company, not something that
 * can be re-counted for an arbitrary fortnight. Letting the picker appear to
 * filter them would be a lie told by a working control, which is worse than no
 * control at all — so it is said in plain words above the table.
 *
 * **Most of the per-service columns have no source.** The platform meters voice
 * minutes and messages against a plan allowance. It does not, today, publish a
 * per-service overage rate or a per-service charge to a customer's own admin.
 * Those cells say "Not available yet" rather than showing $0.00, because a zero
 * on a billing screen reads as "you owe nothing for this" and gets planned
 * around. The one thing we will not do here is invent a number.
 *
 * What IS solid is the period total and the breakdown underneath it: those come
 * from the server's own figures for every call in the period, so they agree
 * with the invoice by construction.
