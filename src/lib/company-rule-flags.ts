/* Seeding a value and locking a value are two different jobs. One flag was doing both.
 *
 * Every setting on the company record (see src/lib/company-defaults.ts) carries a
 * single `override` boolean, and two parts of the product read it with opposite
 * meanings:
 *
 *   - As a LOCK. src/lib/company-policy.ts turns it into `allows(field)`, and
 *     src/components/common-settings/index.tsx disables the control when that is
 *     false. Here `override: true` reads as "this person MAY change it themselves".
 *   - As a COPY INSTRUCTION. `seSettingsData` in
 *     src/pages/admin-settings/people/update-forwarding/index.tsx copies the
 *     company value onto the person only when the flag is on. Here `override: true`
 *     reads as "PUT this company value on the person".
 *
 * So the flag runs backwards against itself. Left off — which is how an admin reads
 * "lock this for everyone" — the person gets none of the company value AND cannot set
 * it themselves: the worst of both. Turned on, the value lands but the lock is gone.
 * "Everyone gets this and nobody may change it" — the most common thing an admin
 * actually wants, and the only sane setting for call recording in a regulated tenant —
 * cannot be said at all.
 *
 * established systems keeps these apart deliberately: a template seeds values onto a person, a
 * User Settings Policy locks them. other established systems does the same with its assignable policies.
 * This module is that separation, expressed as two independent booleans per rule:
 *
 *   apply   — put this company value onto the person
 *   locked  — the person may not change it themselves
 *
 *   apply / locked  →  everyone gets it and it stays that way   (impossible until now)
 *   apply / open    →  a starting point people may change       (old `override: true`)
 *   skip  / locked  →  hands off; whatever they have is frozen  (old `override: false`)
 *   skip  / open    →  the company has no opinion at all        (was unsayable too)
 *
 * The flags live beside `override` in the same rule node — `recording.apply`,
 * `recording.locked`, `recording.override` — so no migration is needed and a record
 * can be understood by old and new readers at the same time. Nothing here is a React
 * hook or does any I/O; it is pure reading and writing of the settings object, so it
 * can be used from a component, a hook, or a form submit handler alike.

 * locked). With `override: false` or the key absent, today: nothing is copied (not
 * apply), and `allows()` returns false so the control is disabled (locked) — absent
 * and false behave identically because `allows` tests `=== true`.
 *
 * So a legacy record can only ever say apply XOR locked, which is exactly why the
 * other two combinations were unsayable. Reading it back this way reproduces today's
 * behaviour for both values, and nobody's phone changes on deploy.

/* WHAT A NEW RECORD WRITES BACK INTO THE OLD FLAG.
 *
 * The old readers keep reading `override` until every call site is migrated, so it has
 * to stay populated and it has to stay sensible. Two of the four combinations map
 * exactly (apply+open → true, skip+locked → false) and round-trip byte-identically.
 * The other two have to lose a half, and `override` mirrors `apply` for both.
 *
 * The case that matters is apply+locked, the one this whole model exists for. Writing
 * `true` means an old reader applies the value and misses the lock. Writing `false`
 * means it holds the lock and never applies the value — so the setting the admin
 * insisted on for everyone is simply absent from every phone provisioned through an
 * unmigrated path. Take call recording: `true` leaves recording on for everyone with a
 * switch a determined person could flip; `false` leaves recording off for everyone.
 * The first failure needs a deliberate act, is visible in the person's own settings,
 * and leaves an audit trail. The second is silent, universal, and is precisely the bug
 * being fixed. `true` is the safer half to keep.
 *
 * skip+open ("no opinion") follows the same rule and lands on `false`. That is the
 * conservative direction there too: `false` only over-disables a control in the UI —
 * which is already what a tenant sees today for an untouched field, so no regression
 * and no data change — while `true` would seed an uncurated company value onto real
 * phones. `apply` is the half that changes data, so `apply` is the half `override`
 * carries.
