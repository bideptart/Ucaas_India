/**
 * Billing ▸ Modules & access.
 *
 * Why a part of the product is not there.
 *
 * Whole areas are gated by the tenant's plan: the Campaign menu, for one, is
 * only rendered when `plan_features.campaign.IS_SHOW` is true, and every route
 * beneath it is guarded by the same flag — so a hidden module cannot even be
 * reached by typing the URL. Nothing in the product said so, which left people
 * hunting for screens that were never going to appear.
 *
 * Two different things can hide a module, and they are fixed in different
 * places, so they are reported separately rather than collapsed into one
 * "unavailable":
 *
 *   - not on the plan      -> the module was never bought or provisioned
 *   - your role cannot see -> it is on the plan, but this role lacks `view`
 *
 * The list unions the keys the API returns with a known catalogue, so a module
 * added server-side appears without a code change *and* a module the plan omits
 * entirely is still reported — the omitted one being, of course, exactly the one
 * someone is looking for.
