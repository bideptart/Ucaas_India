/**
 * Company voicemail
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Setting voicemail rules once for the whole organisation is standard in
 * established business phone systems. Here there was no such screen: the
 * company record already
 * carried `settings.voicemail_pin`, other code already read it, but the only
 * editor for it was the per-person dialog. The company-level card that would
 * have written it sits commented out in
 * src/pages/admin-settings/templates/user-settings/add-edit-user-settings/settings/index.tsx
 * (lines 124-157), so the value was displayed and copied around but could never
 * be set at company level. This page is the missing editor.
 *
 * Storage follows the rest of Company info: the reserved user_template row
 * called "Company Default", whose `settings` column is a free-form JSON blob.
 * The EXISTING key is reused — no new namespace — because other code already
 * reads it:
 *
 *   settings.voicemail_pin = {
 *     value:             string,          // the PIN
 *     users:             ISELECTVALUE[],  // shared-voicemail recipients
 *     voicemail_to_text: 'YES' | 'NO',
 *     override:          boolean,
 *   }
 *
 * `users` is not edited here (picking named people as everyone's shared
 * mailbox is a per-person choice, not a company rule) but it is spread through
 * untouched on save, as is the rest of the settings blob.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT ACTUALLY TAKES EFFECT (grepped when this file was written)
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `override` — REAL. Read by src/lib/company-policy.ts:32
 *   (POLICY_FIELDS.voicemail = 'voicemail_pin.override'), compared at
 *   src/lib/company-policy.ts:74, and consumed by
 *   src/components/common-settings/index.tsx:48 (useCompanyPolicy) through
 *   canEditField, which disables the Voicemail Settings button on a person's
 *   own settings page. It is also read at
 *   src/pages/admin-settings/people/update-forwarding/index.tsx:787,
 *   where a true flag copies this whole voicemail_pin block onto a user when an
 *   admin applies this record as their template.
 *
 * `voicemail_to_text` — STORED. Nothing reads the company copy except the
 *   template-copy path above. The per-person editors
 *   (src/components/common-settings/voicemail-dialog/index.tsx:113-115) read
 *   and write each person's own value, never this one, so changing it here
 *   turns transcription on for nobody who already exists.
 *
 * `value` (the PIN) — STORED. No screen in this product asks for a voicemail
 *   PIN at any point; the key is only carried between form and record
 *   (src/pages/settings/general/index.tsx:177,
 *   src/components/common-settings/voicemail-dialog/index.tsx:62). Nothing
 *   checks it when a mailbox is opened.
 *
 * Keep those notes honest. If the backend starts acting on a key, change that
 * card's `status` and rewrite its note — a stale reassurance here is worse than
 * no page. "Coming soon" means we have not built it; "In this app only" means
 * the browser does the work and nothing behind it checks again.
