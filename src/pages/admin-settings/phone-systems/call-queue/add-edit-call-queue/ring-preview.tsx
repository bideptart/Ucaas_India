/* What the queue's rules would actually do to a caller.
 *
 * Ring settings are easy to set and hard to picture. An admin choosing a
 * strategy, a widening delay and a give-up time has no way of knowing what those
 * three add up to until a real caller is affected by them — and by then it is a
 * complaint rather than a setting.
 *
 * This walks the caller's wait second by second through the same function the
 * routing itself uses (`lib/acd-routing.ts`), and shows what changes and when.
 * Because it is the same function, the preview cannot drift from the behaviour:
 * if one is wrong they are both wrong, which is far easier to notice.
 *
 * It assumes everybody is free, and says so. Live duty state belongs to the
 * switch, and a preview that guessed at it would be worse than one that is clear
 * about what it is showing — this answers "are my rules sensible", not "what is
 * happening right now".
