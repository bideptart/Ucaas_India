/**
 * Company voicemail
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Setting voicemail rules once for the whole organisation is standard in
 * established business phone systems. Here there was no such screen: the
 * company record already
 * carried `settings.voicemail_pin`, other code already read it, but the only
 * editor for it was the per-person dialog. The company-level card that would
 * have written it sits commented out in
 * src/pages/admin-settings/templates/user-settings/add-edit-user-settings/settings/index.tsx
 * (lines 124-157), so the value was displayed and copied around but could never
 * be set at company level. This page is the missing editor.
 *
 * Storage follows the rest of Company info: the reserved user_template row
 * called "Company Default", whose `settings` column is a free-form JSON blob.
 * The EXISTING key is reused — no new namespace — because other code already
 * reads it:
 *
 *   settings.voicemail_pin = {
 *     value:             string,          // the PIN
 *     users:             ISELECTVALUE[],  // shared-voicemail recipients
 *     voicemail_to_text: 'YES' | 'NO',
 *     override:          boolean,
 *   }
 *
 * `users` is not edited here (picking named people as everyone's shared
 * mailbox is a per-person choice, not a company rule) but it is spread through
 * untouched on save, as is the rest of the settings blob.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT ACTUALLY TAKES EFFECT (grepped when this file was written)
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `override` — REAL. Read by src/lib/company-policy.ts:32
 *   (POLICY_FIELDS.voicemail = 'voicemail_pin.override'), compared at
 *   src/lib/company-policy.ts:74, and consumed by
 *   src/components/common-settings/index.tsx:48 (useCompanyPolicy) through
 *   canEditField, which disables the Voicemail Settings button on a person's
 *   own settings page. It is also read at
 *   src/pages/admin-settings/people/update-forwarding/index.tsx:787,
 *   where a true flag copies this whole voicemail_pin block onto a user when an
 *   admin applies this record as their template.
 *
 * `voicemail_to_text` — STORED. Nothing reads the company copy except the
 *   template-copy path above. The per-person editors
 *   (src/components/common-settings/voicemail-dialog/index.tsx:113-115) read
 *   and write each person's own value, never this one, so changing it here
 *   turns transcription on for nobody who already exists.
 *
 * `value` (the PIN) — STORED, AND NO LONGER EDITED HERE. The control was taken
 *   off this screen because nothing on the switch ever asks for a PIN: grepped
 *   again on 1 Sep 2026 across `save-voicemail.lua`, `read-voicemail.lua` and
 *   `functions.lua`, with no hit. The key itself is left alone — the save
 *   spreads the stored block through untouched rather than writing `value` from
 *   a form that no longer holds it, so an existing PIN is preserved rather than
 *   blanked. Put the control back only alongside a mailbox that asks for one. No screen in this product asks for a voicemail
 *   PIN at any point; the key is only carried between form and record
 *   (src/pages/settings/general/index.tsx:177,
 *   src/components/common-settings/voicemail-dialog/index.tsx:62). Nothing
 *   checks it when a mailbox is opened.
 *
 * Keep those notes honest. If the backend starts acting on a key, change that
 * card's `status` and rewrite its note — a stale reassurance here is worse than
 * no page. "Coming soon" means we have not built it; "In this app only" means
 * the browser does the work and nothing behind it checks again.
 */

const VOICEMAIL_KEY = 'voicemail_pin';

/* WHAT WOULD MAKE THE EMAIL ACTUALLY SEND, checked on the switch 1 Sep 2026.
 * Everything except one hop already exists:
 *
 *   - `notification-api` is running on this box and answers
 *     `POST 127.0.0.1:3002/api/v1/send-email` with `{email, subject, body}`.
 *     It is bound to loopback only, which is right - the switch is a local
 *     caller, and nothing off-box should be able to send mail through it.
 *   - Its SMTP is configured and points at Gmail (`smtp.gmail.com:587`) with a
 *     dedicated sender, `notifications@mycountrymobile.com`.
 *   - `voicemail_save()` in the FreeSWITCH `functions.lua` already holds every
 *     fact the mail needs by the time the caller hangs up: `accountcode`,
 *     `vm_msgfile`, the duration, and the caller's number.
 *
 * The missing hop is that `voicemail_save()` records to disk and stops. It
 * tells nothing that a message arrived. Until that call is added, this card
 * records the choice and no mail is sent, which is what its note says.
 * The patch lives in `backend-patches/fs-xml-api/`.
