 * The shape every Admin list page takes.
 *
 * Admin screens open with a breadcrumb strip — "Numbers › Number In Use" — with
 * both halves rendered at the same weight, and a search box crammed in beside
 * it. This gives them the console's page head instead: a real title, a line
 * saying what the screen is for, and a separate bar for search and actions.
 *
 * It deliberately does *not* replace `TableManager`. That component carries
 * server-side paging, sorting and the search plumbing these pages depend on;
 * swapping it out to gain a nicer table would trade real behaviour for looks.
 * The table styling comes from `.mcm-admin table` in the design system.
