/* The money rules behind every billing screen.
 *
 * Billing is the one part of the product where a wrong number is not a bug you
 * fix quietly — it is a refund conversation, and sometimes a chargeback. So the
 * arithmetic lives here, on its own, with tests, instead of being scattered
 * through the components that happen to display it.
 *
 * Three things this module is careful about, and why:
 *
 * 1. **"We don't know" is not zero.** An API that returns nothing for a figure
 *    is telling us it has no answer. Printing $0.00 turns that silence into a
 *    claim — the customer reads "you owe nothing" and plans around it. Every
 *    figure that reaches a screen goes through `knownNumber` first, which keeps
 *    a real 0 and turns anything unknown into `null` so the screen can say
 *    "Not available yet" instead of inventing a fact.
 *
 * 2. **The proration here matches what the server actually charges.** The
 *    server works in 30-day months (a "month" is 30 days no matter which month
 *    it is), rounds to the cent, and never charges a positive amount below
 *    $0.51 because card processors reject smaller ones. If this module rounded
 *    differently, the drawer would promise one number and the card statement
 *    would show another. The rules are copied deliberately, and the tests pin
 *    them, so a change on either side shows up as a failing test rather than a
 *    surprised customer.
 *
 * 3. **Currency is Indian Rupees.** This is an India-only product, so every
 *    figure a customer sees is converted to INR at display time and shown
 *    with the ₹ symbol — kept in one place here rather than guessed per
 *    component. The underlying proration math (`prorate`, `MINIMUM_CHARGE`,
 *    etc.) stays in its own consistent unit; only `formatMoney` converts, so
 *    a figure is never accidentally converted twice.
