/* The frame around every company settings screen.
 *
 * These nine screens used to be one page holding `activeSection` in state, so
 * all nine shared a single URL. Nothing could be linked to, a reload always
 * landed back on the first section, the back button skipped the whole area, and
 * one permission guarded the lot — including Security, which sits behind the
 * phone-system permission and therefore opens for anyone who can view the phone
 * system.
 *
 * Each section is now a route. This component holds only what they share: the
 * heading, the sub-navigation, and the outlet the section renders into. The nav
 * is built from the same table the router uses, so a section cannot appear in
 * one and not the other.
 *
 * The heading and the switcher are one header block (`cs-head` + `tabnav` in
 * mcm-page.css) rather than a heading followed by a separate strip. The row is
 * not in a container of its own: it sits on the header's surface, and the
 * header's closing hairline is the line the tabs stand on, with the open
 * section marked by a 3px accent rule laid over that hairline. Twelve sections
 * do not fit across a laptop, so the row scrolls sideways — by wheel, by
 * dragging, by keyboard focus, or with the chevron that appears at whichever
 * end still has sections behind it.
 *
 * `tabnav` is deliberately not `ptabstrip`, the strip used by admin home,
 * billing, call coverage, departments and numbers. Restyling that class would
 * have redesigned five other pages; this is its own component, and those pages
 * are untouched.
