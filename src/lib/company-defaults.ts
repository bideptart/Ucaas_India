/* The company level of the settings cascade.
 *
 * A phone system needs three levels: what the whole company gets, what a named
 * preset gets, and what one person has. This platform shipped the bottom two —
 * `user_template` holds named presets, and each user carries their own settings —
 * but nothing held "the rule for everyone". Admin > Phone System > Preferences was
 * built for that job and, with nowhere to save to, was wired to the signed-in
 * admin's own record instead, which meant an admin setting a company rule was
 * quietly editing their own phone.
 *
 * Rather than add a table, the top level is stored as a reserved user template.
 * That table already holds exactly the right shape — a settings JSON and a
 * greetings JSON, with the same `override` flags the cascade needs — and the
 * upsert/list endpoints already exist, so the company level works against the
 * running backend with no migration and no deploy.
 *
 * The reserved name is how it is found. It is deliberately one that reads
 * correctly if it ever shows up in the ordinary template list, because it will.
